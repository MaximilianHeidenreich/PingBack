<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

PingBack tries to be a relatively unbiased yet powerful application for you to aggregate, filter and monitor events from any source. It is built on top of the wonderful [Deta](https://deta.space) platform, meaning that all of your data is owned by you and it is *100% free*. <small>(Finally, no more monthly fees you have to worry about).</small>

### Use-Cases

*todo write*

### Project Goals

**Aggregate**
- Store events and expose a simple API / client libraries for easy integration.
- Make managing your data easy by providing import/export options and advanced storage configuration (e.g. max. event age).

**Filter**
- Different options to search for specific events and filter them by multiple parameters.

**Monitor**
- Notifications (Push Notifications, Webhooks and Integrations with 3th party apps)
- Metrics *todo explain*
- Charts *todo explain*

*Additionaly, look pretty and have a nice User Experience ;)*

## Credit

I needed an app for this purpose for a long time now but never came around to build one.
*Shayan* over at [LogSnag](https://logsnag.com) already created a Saas product for this.
PingBack is heavily inspired by LogSnag, but build for the [Deta Space](https://deta.space) 
platform and therefore **100% free** (in addition to the other benefits of using a personal cloud).
