<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## ‚ö°Ô∏è TL;DR

Many times, be it a software project a website or a Saas product of yours, there is a need to track events like installations, page visits, user signups, payments etc.

PingBack is a relatively unbiased yet powerful application which enables you to:

1. **Aggregate** events from any source that can send a basic HTTP POST request.
2. **Filter** all previous events and create data visualizations so that you can focus on the most important KPI's.
3. **Monitor** single specific events, event frequency and create alerts to notify you / other systems through Push Notifications or Webhooks.

It is built on top of the wonderful [Deta](https://deta.space) platform, meaning that all of your data is owned by you and it is *100% free*. <small>(Finally, no more monthly fees you have to worry about).</small>

### ‚ú® Notable Features
- Aggregate events from any HTTP enabled source.
- Live updates & notifications.
- PWA support.
- Organize events by projects, channels and custom identifiers.
Filter events.

### üöß Roadmap
> I released the current version so that testing and feedback is possible. Please not that PingBack is not fully finished yet. Things are still missing / might break, but the essentials are already implemented.

#### 1.2.0
- Push notifications

<!-- CREDIT -->

## Credit

I needed an app for this purpose for a long time now but never came around to build one.
*Shayan* over at [LogSnag](https://logsnag.com) already created a Saas product for this.
PingBack is heavily inspired by LogSnag, but build for the [Deta Space](https://deta.space)
platform and therefore **100% free** (in addition to the other benefits of using a personal cloud).
