# ⚡️ TL;DR

Many times, be it a software project a website or a Saas product of yours, there is a need to track events
like installations, page visits, user signups, payments etc.

PingBack is a relatively unbiased yet powerful application which enables you to:
1. **Aggregate** events from any source that can send a basic HTTP POST request.
2. **Filter** all previous events and create data visualizations so that you can focus on the most important KPI's.
3. **Monitor** single specific events, event frequency and create alerts to notify you / other systems through Push Notifications or Webhooks.

## ✨ Notable Features
- Aggregate events from any HTTP enabled source.
- Live updates & notifications.
- PWA support.
- Organize events by projects, channels and custom identifiers.
- Filter events.

## 🚧 Roadmap

> I released the current version so that testing and feedback is possible. Please not that PingBack is not fully finished yet.
Things are still missing / might break, but the essentials are already implemented.

- Push notifications
- Live Metrics
- Monitoring
- Import / Export data

**Additional information:**
I had the Idea for this service on my todo list for a long time but never came around to implement it.
In the mean time, *shayan* created [LogSnag](https://logsnag.com). LogSnag is awesome, but if you want to choose
a free alternative with some additional features, you can give *PingBack* a try ^^
