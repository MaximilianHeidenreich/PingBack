# ðŸš§ Under construction

I released the current version so that testing and feedback is possible. Please not that PingBack is not finished yet.
Many things are still missing / might break, but the essentials are already implemented.

## TL;DR

PingBack tries to be a relatively unbiased yet powerful application for you to
aggregate, filter and monitor events from any source.

### Aggregate
Events can be collected by using one of our [Client Libraries](https://maximilianheidenreich.gitbook.io/pingback/client-libraries) for your favorite language, or by simply sending an HTTP request to a specific endpoint. You can find more information on that inside the [Quick Start](https://maximilianheidenreich.gitbook.io/pingback/quick-start).
Additionally, PingBack offers different options for storing and exporting events. By default, there is no limit on the amount or max. time of events stored, but you can enable cleanup options to limit the time certain events are stored. Events can also be exported to standard formats like JSON and CSV.

### Filter
Storing events provides no additional value if you can't filter them. PingBack offers different options to search for specific events and filter them by multiple parameters.

### Monitor
Something will break, eventually and even if it doesn't, it is useful to be notified when things happen. PingBack offers multiple ways [... webhooks, push notification].
Furthermore, it provides you with options to stay on top of your most important KPI's with features such as Metrics and Charts

**Additional information:**
I had the Idea for this service on my todo list for a long time but never came around to implement it.
In the mean time, *shayan* created [LogSnag](https://logsnag.com). LogSnag is awesome, but if you want to choose
a free alternative with some additional features, you can give *PingBack* a try ^^
