    Note: The following examples assume that you have not deleted the `default` project & channel. If you have,
    just change the `project` and `channel` properties to match your own.

## Submitting your first event

The simplest way to submit your first event is by using the code snippets below. Alternativle, you can use one of the
provided [Client SDKs](/clientlibraries).

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Java-/TypeScript & NodeJS/Deno", "Python"]}>
    <Tab>
        ```shell copy
        curl --location --request POST "<APP_URL>/api/v1/events" \
            --header "X-API-Key: <API_KEY>" \
            --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
            --data-raw '{
                "project": "default",
                "channel": "default",
                "name": "test",
                "title": "Hello from cURL",
                "description": "Place for more information abount the event.",
                "icon": ":rocket:"
            }'
        ```

        > In NodeJS environments older than v18 you have to use a polyfill for `fetch` (e.g. [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)).

        ```javascript copy
        fetch("<APP_URL>/api/v1/events", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
                "X-Api-Key": "<API_KEY>",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                project: "default",
                channel: "default",
                name: "test",
                title: "Hello from Java-/TypeScript",
                description: "Place for more information abount the event.",
                icon: ":rocket:",
            })
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```python copy
        import requests

        requests.post("<APP_URL>/api/v1/events",
            headers = {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
                "X-Api-Key": "<API_KEY>",
            },
            json = {
                "project": "default",
                "channel": "default",
                "name": "test",
                "title": "Hello from Python",
                "description": "Place for more information abount the event.",
                "icon": ":rocket:",

            },
        )
        ```

- `<APP_URL>` is the URL at which your PingBack instance is hosted (e.g. `https://pingback-1-d2924350.deta.app`).
If you set up a custom domain for your PingBack instance, you can use that instead.
- `<API_KEY>` is an API key for the project which you can copy from the "projects" tab.
- `name` is a short (max. 50 chars) key which identifies the "type" of the event.
You can use this to further subdivide events (e.g. "payments", "payments.success" and "payments.failed").
Later on you can use this to filter events.
- `title` is a short string (max. 25 chars) outlining what the event represents.
- `description` is an optional addition containing additional information about the event.
- `icon` is an optional unicode emoji or emoji-code (see. [Emoji Cheatsheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)).


## Advanced events

In addition to the basic event properties, you can also utilize some additional ones as well as add any JSON data to your events.
All properties are described below.

- `tags` is an optional JSON object you can use to store additional data about the event.
Tags can also be filtered as described in [Filtering events](/guide/filter).
- `parser` is an optional string (one of: `text`, `markdown`) which tells PingBack how to parse the `description` property.
Defaults to `text` if not set.
- `notify` is an optional boolean which tells PingBack whether to notify clients upon event submission.
