# Welcome to PingBack.

> What is this all about and what can PingBack do?

## TL;DR â€” Aggrgate, Filter and Monitor.

Many times, be it a software project a website or a Saas product of yours, there is a need to track events
like installations, page visits, user signups, payments etc.

PingBack is a relatively unbiased yet powerful application which enables you to:
1. **Aggregate** events from any source that can send a basic HTTP POST request.
2. **Filter** all previous events and create data visualizations so that you can focus on the most important KPI's.
3. **Monitor** single specific events, event frequency and create alerts to notify you / other systems through Push Notifications or Webhooks.

It is build on top of the wonderful [Deta Space](https://deta.space) platform, meaning that all of your data is only accessible and owned by you.
At any time, you can import new or export your existing data.

### Aggregate

PingBack operates on the concept of single, atomic events. An event is an immutable, timestamped piece of data that can represent anything from a user
signup or application error to a raw JSON object.
An event can store a title, description (*text, markdown, raw JSON*) and additional tags allowing you to use them for many different use cases and
effectively filter through them afterwards.

Events are submitted simply by calling a HTTP POST endpoint or by using one of our [Client Libraries](/clientlibraries) for your favourite language.

Finally, by default events have no expiration time, but there is the option to enable different cleanup strategies.

### Filter

The filter bar allows you to quickly find an event / a group of events by specifying one or many combinations of projects, channels, full text search and comparisons.

#### Live Metrics (Coming soon)

The Metrics page provides powerful and pretty data visualizations like graphs, flow charts and more which react to live changes.

### Monitor (Coming soon)

Something will break, evetually and even if it doesn't, it might be useful to be notified when thign happen in your application.
PingBack offers you several features to stay informed about what's happening.

#### Push Notifications (Coming soon)

The most basic way is by enabling Notifications for the webapp or even Push Notifications if you have the PWA Version installed.
Upon each new received event, you will be notified on all your devices (*Notifications can also selectively be disabled for specific projects, channels and events*).

#### Alerts (Coming soon)

Custom alerts can be defined which will trigger a custom action like a notification or a webhook if a specific requirement is met.
E.g. This can be used to only be notified of a specific event which is submitted X amount of times in Y minutes.
